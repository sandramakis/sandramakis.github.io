        </header>

        <p class="hidden">
          My journey in web development began a few years ago, as an
          undergraduate of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka pursuing a degree
          in B.A History and International Studies where I leared of how the
          world evolves and how the world is slowly becoming technologized.Since
          then, I have developed a strong proficiency in learning web
          development and has used various front-end frameworks.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="hidden">
          My goal is to create engaging and user-friendly websites that not only
          look great but also deliver exceptional user experiences. I strive to
          stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and technologies to
          ensure that my work reflects modern standards and best practices in
          front-end development, ensuring that my work is always at the
          forefront of industry standards.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="hidden">
          I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working closely with
          designers and back-end developers to bring projects to life.I have a
          meticulous eye for detail and a knack for creating intuitive user
          experiences. I have a strong ability to translate design concepts into
          responsive and interactive websites, ensuring seamless functionality
          across different devices and browsers.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="hidden">
          I believe in continuous learning and I'm always eager to expand my
          skill set. I'm open to new challenges and enjoy finding innovative
          solutions to complex problems. I believe that every user should have a
          seamless experience, regardless of the device they are using or any
          accessibility challenge they may face. In the future, I hope to expand
          my coat to back-end and Web3, so I'm working towards that.

              Experienced in using Git for version control, including creating

              managing commits.

            <h4>Frontend Frameworks</h4>
            <p>
              While I'm proficient in using Bootstrap, Tailwind and partly SASS,
              HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript are my strong suit in making
              interactive and functional websites. I understand the importance
              of other programming frameworks which I'm yet to acquire, but I
              must in due time.

            <h4>Responsive Web Design</h4>
            <p>
              Small screens (phone screens less than 368px) tend to be a problem
              when it comes to displaying these websites or apps. I have become
              familiar with these development. The solution that works for me is
              the "small screen first", then larger screens. I enure that
              websites display change dynamically depending on the viewport
              ranging from laptops to tablets to phones.
